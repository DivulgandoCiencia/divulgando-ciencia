Discover how the Greek mathematician, Eratosthenes, measured the Earth using just a stick on the summer solstice.

On June 21st, we celebrate the **summer solstice**, marking the beginning of summer.

Over 2000 years ago, a mathematician named **Eratosthenes** had the brilliant idea of **calculating the Earth's radius with just a stick**. Wondering how? Let's find out!

## Procedure

1. First, he got a **stick** (a crucial step if you want to calculate the Earth's radius with a stick, pardon the redundancy).
2. At **solar noon** on the day of the **summer solstice** (precisely), he placed the stick at a 90-degree angle to the ground.
3. He measured the **angle** formed by the **top of the stick** and the **end of its shadow**.

4. Once he had the angle measurement, he needed one of the most crucial pieces of information: **the distance from where he was** (Alexandria) **to a location on the Tropic of Cancer** (he used Syene). To calculate this distance, he measured how much a slave's step was and had the slave walk the entire distance from Alexandria to Syene.
5. With all the data in hand, he made the following calculation to find the Earth's radius (**important: the angle measure must be in radians**):
   r = distance/angle

And that's how Eratosthenes discovered the Earth's radius with this simple reasoning, or maybe not so simple? Let's see the explanation!

## Explanation of How Eratosthenes Measured the Earth with a Simple Stick

Exactly at **solar noon** on the **summer solstice**, the Sun's rays fall on the Tropic of Cancer in a way that **no object casts a shadow**.

If you stand anywhere at that time and measure the angle formed by the stick you've placed and its shadow, you'll observe that this angle is **exactly the same** as the one formed by the arc from where you took the measurements to the Tropic of Cancer.

## Demonstration

Of course, it's not helpful to just tell you all this without a **demonstration**, so here we go! I'm going to show you step by step how I replicated what Eratosthenes did over two thousand years ago.

1. The first step I took was to grab a **stick**; since I couldn't find one, I decided to use a bottle (you know, recycling).
2. I waited for the solar noon on **June 21, 2022 (14:20)**, and when the time came, I placed the bottle on a flat surface. I measured the length of the bottle and its shadow, and the data were as follows:
    - **Bottle length = 26 cm.**
    - **Shadow length = 10 cm.**
3. Once at home, I calculated the arctangent of these two measurements by dividing them to find the angle in radians they formed:

**arctan (10/26) = arctan(0.38) = 0.3631 rad**

4. Finally, I divided the distance from where I did it to the Tropic of Cancer (assuming the distance = 2315 km):

**r = 2315/0.3631 = 6375 km**
