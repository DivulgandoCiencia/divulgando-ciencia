    texto="Hello! We are DarÃ­o and Dorian, two students passionate about science and, specifically, scientific outreach. We started this website as a way to do what we love: disseminate science and share scientific knowledge with the rest of the world. What began as a hobby has now evolved into a website where we want our audience to feel the same passion for scientific outreach and science as we do. We want you to gain new knowledge every time you visit, to find all the scientific information you're looking for, to freely explore articles on your favorite science topics..."
