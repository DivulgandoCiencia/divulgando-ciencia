She was a scientist from a Polish family, born in the USA, and she dedicated her life to **Chemistry**. She made a discovery that saved many people's lives: **Kevlar**.

Ever since she was little, she loved science and wanted to study **Medicine** to save lives. But she couldn't afford it, so she got a degree in Chemistry instead and started working at the **Du Pont company** to earn money so she could **become a doctor**.

She liked her job at Du Pont so much that **she didn't want to study Medicine anymore** and **kept working with polymers**. In 1965, she discovered a liquid and sticky polymer, **Kevlar**, which many people thought was a mistake. Stephanie even had to argue with a technician to get him to turn this substance into a fiber. The result was amazing: **poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide**, better known as Kevlar.

Kevlar has as many as 200 uses, from **tires** to **space equipment**, **underwater cables**, **helmets**, **brake pads**, and **bulletproof vests**\! It saves a lot of lives with that last use.

One interesting story is that one day, a big police officer came up to Stephanie Kwolek after she discovered Kevlar. He asked her to **sign her autograph on his bulletproof vest** made of the material that had just stopped two bullets from hitting his heart.

Some of her big awards include:

  - ***Material Achievement Award*** (1978) – For discovering Kevlar
  - ***National Medal of Technology and Innovation*** (1996) – Given by President Bill Clinton
  - ***Perkin Medal*** (1997)

> If the results I get aren't completely good, I usually don't throw away what comes out. I keep doing tests, I keep trying to see if I can get something out of it. - Stephanie Kwolek
