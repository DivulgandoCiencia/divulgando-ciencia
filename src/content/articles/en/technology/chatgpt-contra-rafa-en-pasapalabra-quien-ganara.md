## ChatGPT vs. Rafa in Pasapalabra: Who Will Win?

In this article, we will try to bring together two major topics of the moment: ChatGPT and Rafa's victory in Pasapalabra. To do this, we will pit them against each other: ChatGPT versus Rafa, who will win?

First of all, it's worth mentioning that the Pasapalabra contestant, Rafa, won the largest jackpot in the show's history on Thursday: 2,272,000 euros. He did so by correctly answering all 25 questions of the "rosco" in one go. Without a doubt, the word "zabro" will forever remain in his head, which, according to the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE), means "a beetle of the family Carabidae that attacks wheat fields, especially when the grains are tender."

One of the great artificial intelligences of the moment is [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), which, through a text prompt, generates the most appropriate response possible to that text, whether it's a question, a request, etc. Thus, I asked this artificial intelligence to solve the "rosco," question by question, and to give a percentage of difficulty to each question.

To conduct this experiment, we will introduce the following initial prompt (input) to ChatGPT, referring to the Pasapalabra contest:

"Act as a Pasapalabra contestant. I will give you a question. The first letter of the prompt will be the initial letter of the answer, for example, 'A. Fruit of the apple tree,' where the answer is 'Apple,' which starts with A. You have to answer with two things: the answer you think is correct and the percentage of difficulty you would give to that question. Do you understand?"

After its affirmative response, I began asking it the following questions (one per prompt), to which it responded with its answer and a percentage of difficulty.

## ChatGPT's Answers to the Rosco

As we well know, Rafa answered all the questions of the Pasapalabra "rosco" with hardly any time to think. Will the same happen with ChatGPT? We will mark the correct answers of OpenAI's artificial intelligence with a B and the incorrect ones with an M.

| Question | Rafa | ChatGPT |

|A. Mechanism for spreading a liquid under pressure, like water for irrigation.|Aspersor|Aspersor (B)|
|B. Front opening of trousers.|Bragueta|Bragueta (B)|

|Z. Beetle that attacks wheat fields, especially when the grains are tender.|Zabro|Zabro (B)|

As we can see, ChatGPT only missed one question: the second to last one. That is, it got 24 out of 25 questions right. It wouldn't have won the jackpot\! But, as Roberto Leal would have said, it was just one question away from 2,272,000 euros. This is a clear example of how artificial intelligences, in this case ChatGPT, still have a lot to improve to be able to beat a human being, at least in the Pasapalabra "rosco."

## According to ChatGPT, What Was the Difficulty Level of This Pasapalabra Rosco?

As I said at the beginning, I asked this artificial intelligence to tell me the percentage of difficulty for each question in addition to the answer it believed was correct. Below you can see the percentage of difficulty it assigned to each question.

A. Mechanism for spreading a liquid under pressure, like water for irrigation.|70%
B. Front opening of trousers.|60%
C. Gallery surrounding the main courtyard of a church or convent.|70%

By taking the arithmetic mean of all the percentages, we obtain that, according to ChatGPT, this "rosco" had a difficulty of 56.4%. But, what was the percentage of other "roscos"? Were they easier or more difficult?

## The Difficulty Level of Other Pasapalabra Roscos

### Rafa's Rosco - 03/01/2023

We have recorded the questions from a Pasapalabra program with a random date (chosen by ChatGPT) featuring Rafa and Orestes. In the following table, we will see the question, the answers provided by the artificial intelligence, the correct answer, and the difficulty level. Logically, neither contestant managed to answer all 25 questions correctly, but will ChatGPT win the jackpot at some point? We will see now.

Furthermore, according to ChatGPT, the difficulty of this "rosco" is 53.6%, supposedly easier than the other one, but despite that, it got fewer answers correct than in the previous "rosco." A bit strange, isn't it?

Z. For a ship to leave the place where it was anchored or docked.|Zarpar (B)|Zarpar|40%

We find that ChatGPT says this Pasapalabra "rosco" has a difficulty of 47.6%, but it is the "rosco" where ChatGPT answered the fewest questions correctly: only 19 questions, while Orestes answered 22 in this same "rosco."

## Conclusions

We obtain the following conclusions after the experiments carried out with ChatGPT in the Pasapalabra contest:

  - According to it, the "rosco" solved entirely by the contestant (Rafa) and the one it solved the most is the most difficult, rated with a difficulty of 56.4%. After that, there is the "rosco" with 20 correct answers for the artificial intelligence, rated with a difficulty of 53.5%, and finally, the "rosco" with the fewest correct answers by the OpenAI program (19 correct answers) is considered by it to be the easiest "rosco," with a difficulty of 47.6%. A bit inconsistent, isn't it?
  - We have also observed how the human has won against the computer on all three occasions: by 1 correct answer, 2, and 3 respectively. We have also observed that there are Pasapalabra questions that the person answers easily while ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence with internet access, is unable to find the answer.
  - It should be noted that, despite telling the artificial intelligence several times that the answer to each question should start with the letter I indicated, on several occasions it responded without using that letter as the initial letter, and sometimes it forgot to tell me the percentage of difficulty it assigned to that question. In short: it sometimes forgot the previous instructions.
  - After all this, we observe that human beings are still more intelligent than current artificial intelligences, and
