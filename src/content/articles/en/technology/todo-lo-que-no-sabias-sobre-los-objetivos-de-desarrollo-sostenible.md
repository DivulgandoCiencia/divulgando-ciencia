Without hunger, without extreme poverty, with equality between men and women, with clean energy, quality education for everyone, a healthy planet… This is how I imagine the world in 2030. And you?

This is more or less what the United Nations (UN) aims to achieve through the implementation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

These were already adopted by 193 countries in 2015, but what do they really mean? What do they have to do with science and technology? Will we manage to achieve them in time?

## What are the SDGs?

The Sustainable Development Goals are a set of 17 objectives. For each of them there are specific targets (169 in total) that will help verify their achievement.

Unlike the Millennium Development Goals (prior to the SDGs, 2000–2015), the new goals are based on the idea of “leaving no one behind”, promoting inclusion and equity.

## 5 pillars of the SDGs: the 5 Ps

The goals are based on five key points, which are the following (the 5 Ps):

1. **People**: end poverty and hunger, uphold human dignity, and promote equality.

2. **Planet**: protect the planet from destruction, including sustainable consumption and eco-friendly management of natural resources.

3. **Prosperity**: promote economic, social, and technological progress in harmony with nature so that all humans can enjoy prosperous lives.

4. **Peace**: peaceful, just, and inclusive societies where violence and fear have no place.

5. **Partnerships** (*partnership* in English): collaboration is vital in order to achieve all these objectives, both between countries or organizations and between individuals.

## The 17 SDGs in detail

We will distinguish four major groups within the SDGs to better understand them:

### Social (SDGs 1–6)

1. **No poverty**: eradicate poverty in all its forms everywhere.

2. **Zero hunger**: ensure that everyone has access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food.

3. **Good health and well-being**: promote healthy lifestyles at all ages.

4. **Quality education**: ensure universal quality education that is free, inclusive, and equitable.

5. **Gender equality**: achieve full equality between genders.

6. **Clean water and sanitation**: ensure access to safe drinking water and sanitation for the entire population.

### Economic (SDGs 7–10)

 7. **Affordable and clean energy**: ensure access to sustainable, reliable, and modern energy for all.

 8. **Decent work and economic growth**: all jobs matter; promote decent and inclusive employment, as well as long-term sustainable economic growth.

 9. **Industry, innovation, and infrastructure**: build resilient infrastructure and foster innovation to progress as a society.

10. **Reduced inequalities**: reduce inequalities among groups.

### Environmental (SDGs 11–15)

11. **Sustainable cities and communities**: make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

12. **Responsible consumption and production**: promote efficient use of resources and, above all, waste reduction.

13. **Climate action**: take urgent measures to combat the increasingly evident and alarming climate change.

14. **Life below water**: conserve oceans, seas, and the resources found within them.

15. **Life on land**: protect different species, both animals and plants, across all ecosystems.

### Institutional (SDGs 16–17)

16. **Peace, justice, and strong institutions**: promote peaceful, just, and inclusive societies, as well as non-violence.

17. **Partnerships for the goals**: strengthen global partnerships to jointly achieve sustainable development.

## Will we manage to achieve the 17 SDGs?

The latest reports on progress toward the different SDGs according to their indicators [(5)](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/)[(6)](https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789213589755) show alarming data: only 17% of the targets are on track to be achieved, while nearly half show minimal or moderate progress, and more than one third are stalled or even regressing.

This may be due to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts between countries, and the climate crisis, which are delaying progress.

- **SDGs with the greatest progress**: child mortality and HIV prevention (part of SDG 3) show significant progress, although not equally across all countries, thanks to medical and public health interventions.

- **Stalled SDGs**: SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 15 (Life on Land) show setbacks due to growing food insecurity and massive deforestation.

We only have 5 years left to complete these goals, so both citizen and political collaboration are essential to achieve them.

## The role of science

Science, like all sectors, plays an important role in achieving these goals. Some of the progress in the SDGs driven by different scientific fields includes:

- **Agricultural biotechnology (SDG 2)**: developing crops resistant to droughts and pests to improve food supply.

- **Climate models (SDG 13)**: used to predict climate scenarios and help prevent the damage they may cause.

- **Nanotechnology and chemistry (SDGs 6 and 12)**: advanced water treatment and biodegradable materials are developed to reduce pollution.

- **Mathematics and data science (SDGs 1, 8, and 13)**: statistical analysis and big data allow estimates of different indicators to identify ways to improve.

- **Technology and programming (SDGs 9 and 17)**: thanks to digital platforms and growing technology, global intercity collaboration is easier to achieve these goals.

## And me, what can I do? 10 actions

The UN provides a guide to actions we can take [(7)](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/es/takeaction/) to help achieve the SDGs. They are classified into four groups: from the couch, at home, outside, and at work. Below are the most notable ones:

### Things I can do from the couch

1. Save electricity by plugging appliances into a power strip and completely disconnecting them when not in use.

2. Share posts you see on social media about women’s rights, climate change, or interesting and important news—don’t just limit yourself to giving a “like”.

### Things I can do at home

3. Take short showers. Avoid baths, as they require many more liters of water.

4. Recycle plastic, glass, and cardboard.

5. Install solar panels to promote renewable solar energy.

6. Buy products with as little plastic as possible and eat less meat and fish: more resources are used to produce meat than to grow plants.

### Things I can do outside

7. Buy local products thoughtfully: support local businesses so people can keep their jobs and reduce long-distance transportation. Also buy oddly shaped fruit that is still in good condition—many pieces of fruit are thrown away simply because they do not have the “right” color, shape, or size, despite being perfectly fine.

8. Get vaccinated and vaccinate my children. Protecting myself also protects others.

### Things I can do at work

 9. When I see any kind of discrimination, speak up and do not remain silent.

10. Go to work by bike, on foot, or using public transportation whenever possible. And if I drive, try to carpool to optimize resources.

## Conclusion

In summary, the SDGs are an unprecedented plan aimed at achieving balanced and fair development. It is everyone’s responsibility to follow and fulfill them, and international cooperation and scientific progress are vital.
