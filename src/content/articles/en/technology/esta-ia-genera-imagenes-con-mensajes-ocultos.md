More and more cool artificial intelligence tools are popping up. Today, we're going to talk about one that lets you make pictures with hidden words inside them\! The main picture for this article was even made with this AI. Can you figure out the secret word?

The AI we're talking about is called **Quick QR Art**, and it has a special section called Fusion that lets you make these kinds of images.

## Steps to Make Your Own Hidden Word Image

### Create an Image with Your Word

First, you need to pick the word you want to hide. Once you've decided, go to a program like **Powerpoint** or **Canva**, or another similar one.

In the program, type your word using a font that's nice and thick. Then, save the picture.

Finally, you need to make the background of this picture disappear. You can use a tool like [remove.bg](https://remove.bg).

### Create a Prompt Using ChatGPT

This step is like giving the AI a really good description of what you want your final picture to look like. It's optional, but it can help make your image even better\! Go to [**ChatGPT**](https://chat.openai.com) and ask it to write a prompt (a description) to help create the image you have in mind.

Type the following into ChatGPT, but replace "<your description>" with what you want your picture to be about:

*"Act as a prompt engineer for an artificial intelligence image generation application. Write a prompt in English for an image of <your description>."*

Copy the prompt that ChatGPT gives you, and then move on to the next step.

### Generate Your Image

Go to Quick QR Art ([click here](https://quickqr.art/app/fusion-art-ai)).

First, you'll need to **sign up** to get 25 free credits to try it out.

After you sign up, make sure you're in the Fusion Art section. Once you're there, go to the **"Upload"** area.

Now that you've entered all the information, click on **"Generate"** and just wait to see what it creates\!

Once it's done, you can download your image to save it on your device.
