Have you ever tried placing drops of water on the surface of a coin? How many do you think would fit? Many more than you think, for sure. In this article, we’ll show you the results with various coins.

## Why Does This Happen?

This behavior is due to a property of water known as surface tension. Surface tension is a force that keeps water molecules together.
Water creates a kind of "invisible fabric" that acts like a waterproof layer and prevents it from spilling (up to a certain point, when there’s too much water, it eventually gives way). We must also consider the small edge of the coins, which helps create this resistant bubble.

## Results

After performing the experiment with a dropper, water, and coins of different denominations, we obtained the following results.

| Coin | Drops |
|-|-|
| **1 cent** | 13 |
| **2 cents** | 20 |
| **5 cents** | 18 |
| **10 cents** | 19 |
| **20 cents** | 19 |

Which one surprised you the most? Did you expect these results?
