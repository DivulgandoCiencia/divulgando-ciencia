Before we begin, this is the second part of an article already written previously ([**The Fourth Dimension: Introduction**](/la-cuarta-dimension-introduccion)). If you haven’t read it, go read it to better understand this article. As you’ve already read in the title, we’re going to talk about movement in the W direction, how it works, and how it could exist among us.

## Movement in W?

As we’ve seen before, each dimension has its own axis of movement (1st X, 2nd Y, 3rd Z…) and the fourth dimension’s axis is W. When moving a 3D object in the Z direction on a 2D plane, at some point the object will disappear. The same happens with 4D: if we move an object in the W direction on a 3D plane, it will eventually disappear.

There’s also rotation in 4D, which looks very strange to our eyes:

What we see here is as if the faces were moving and expanding or shrinking to form another face, while someone who could see in 4D would see it as if we were rotating a cup.

## Teleportation

If a person could move along the W axis, they could **teleport**. Of course, that’s only from our perspective. For them, they would simply be moving as usual, that is, they would just disappear from our plane as we’ve discussed before, move like us (on an X, Z, or Y axis), and reappear in our plane. Unfortunately, we can’t turn this into a teleportation machine, because for something to move in our plane, even if we don’t see it, it has to move the same way we do. The only thing we could create is a machine for interdimensional movement that would allow us to have more space, less traffic, or even infinite memory in a computer, but we won’t talk about that now.

## Conclusion on Movement in W in the Fourth Dimension

- Rotation in 4D is **very strange**.
- Do we confirm teleportation?
