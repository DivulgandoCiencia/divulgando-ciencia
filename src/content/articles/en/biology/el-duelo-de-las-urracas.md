## The Intelligence of Birds

For a long time, traditional science believed that birds had underdeveloped brains and therefore low cognitive abilities—understanding cognition as the capacity to acquire, process, and retain information, which can influence decision-making.

However, many neuroscientists and scientists in general have had to abandon outdated evolutionary ideas after learning more about the brain and behavior of certain birds—especially corvids, which stand out for their remarkable intelligence.

Undoubtedly, in the evolutionary scale of intelligence, humans sit at the top, followed by animals like apes, dolphins, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, and insects—in that order. But among birds, the ones surprising ethologists the most are corvids. These birds are capable of producing highly complex behaviors such as crafting tools, recognizing peers, and establishing group hierarchies.

These animals have a highly developed telencephalon, which suggests they possess a great capacity for complex behaviors and decision-making. It is now known that the avian brain is not as simple as once thought, and that the telencephalon underwent extraordinary development. Today, it's understood that although the cortical region of birds’ brains hasn’t seen major evolutionary changes, the telencephalon has—being composed almost entirely of basal ganglia and tending to be nucleated with little or no laminar organization.

In summary, the long-standing idea within the scientific community that birds are unintelligent due to their small brains and lack of a cerebral cortex is being overturned. Recent studies have shown that these creatures have developed remarkable neural capacities by keeping neurons locally connected, sometimes achieving higher neuronal density per gram of brain than in primates.

## Corvids: Exceptionally Smart Birds

Corvids are a bird family that includes around 120 species distributed across the globe, except for polar regions. These birds have long been regarded as more intelligent than other birds. But today, it’s not just that they’re smarter than other birds—it’s that they may rival animals like primates and dolphins.

These birds can hide food when it's abundant, and they clearly remember the hiding spots to retrieve it later. This ability is especially surprising for a bird, as it involves remembering a specific past event (hiding the food), the location, and a time frame—i.e., when they can retrieve it.

Another astonishing skill is their ability to craft tools—something previously only attributed to apes. In some species, like the New Caledonian crow (*Corvus moneduloides*), individuals have been observed modifying tree branches into hooks to access food or crafting serrated tools to hunt. But it doesn't stop there—corvids, along with parrots and some apes, show the ability to use meta-tools: tools to obtain other tools to solve a problem. This step is crucial in the development of technology in human evolution.

But without a doubt, one species that has continually amazed scientists is the magpie (*Pica pica*), especially for passing the mirror self-recognition test—a feat only achieved by a few animals like dolphins, elephants, and some apes. This test involves marking the animal’s body in a place only visible in a mirror, with a visible colored dot. If the animal uses its reflection to locate and inspect the mark, it’s considered to have self-recognition. Very few species pass this test—and the magpie does.

Furthermore, passing this test suggests that these animals can form advanced social relationships and may even show empathy comparable to some mammals. It has been observed that they can share food with other individuals and even discern who has plenty and who doesn’t.

## The Mourning of Magpies

But the behavior of these creatures is so extraordinary that it became the focus of a study by researchers at the University of Colorado. This study observed birds seemingly guarding the body of a deceased companion. It appears that magpies, like other corvids, react in unique ways to the corpses of their peers—emitting unusual calls, touching the deceased with their beaks, or even harassing people holding a black cloth or a dead corvid (this was tested experimentally). Additionally, magpies seem to leave small structures made of straw and wood next to the bodies.

At first glance, one might think these behaviors are simply a warning of danger—meant to increase the survival of the species—similar to the necrophoresis performed by social insects like ants and termites, which involves quickly removing dead relatives. If that were the case, then these behaviors would have little to do with feelings.

But it’s not so clear-cut. Experts in animal behavior, like Barbara J. King, argue that in many animals, reactions to deceased kin can only be interpreted as mourning behavior. This would represent a paradigm shift in ethology and animal behavior—suggesting that humans are not the only species capable of experiencing emotions like loss and grief over the death of a companion or loved one.
