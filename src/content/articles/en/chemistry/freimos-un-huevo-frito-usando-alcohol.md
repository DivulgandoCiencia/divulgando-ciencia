## Goal

To see how an egg "fries" without needing fire, oil, or a pan.

## Materials

- Plate
- Raw egg
- 96-degree alcohol

## How to Do It

Crack the **egg** onto the plate and then pour the **alcohol** over it.

## What You'll See

Little by little (you'll start seeing the effect almost right away, but the full result will take about an hour), the **egg white will change color** and become **solid**, just like a **real fried egg**. The yolk will stay liquid underneath the white part.

## Why It Happens

When you usually fry an egg, the heat causes the **proteins inside the egg to change their structure**. This change is called **denaturation**, and it can happen not just from heat but also when the egg comes into contact with certain things, like the ethanol in the alcohol.

You can also get a similar and interesting effect if you whisk the egg before adding the alcohol. In that case, you'll get something that looks like a **"scrambled" egg** that will take the shape of the container, like a custard.
