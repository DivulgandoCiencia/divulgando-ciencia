Today we're going to learn how to make **glowing water gel balls**\! We'll explain all the steps to follow to do this simple activity correctly.

## What You'll Need

For this activity, you'll need the following:

1.  **Water gel balls**. You only need a few because they'll get much bigger when you add water.

2.  **Fluorescein**. You only need a very small amount of this too.

3.  **Water**.
4.  A **container** where you'll mix everything and soak the balls.

## Let's Get Started\!

### Making the Glowing Water

First, we need to make the water that will make the gel balls glow. This water will have **water and fluorescein** in it. How much fluorescein you use will change how bright your balls glow.

It's important to know that even a tiny bit of fluorescein can make the water very colorful, so don't pour in a lot at once. Instead, dissolve it **little by little**.

### Putting the Balls in the Water

Once your glowing water is ready, put the **water gel balls** into it in your container.

Remember that these balls grow a lot, so don't put too many in the container, or they won't all fit once they're fully soaked\!

After a few minutes, you'll see the balls starting to grow as they soak up the water. After **a few hours**, they'll reach their biggest size.

## Making Them Glow with UV Light

Once the balls are full of the glowing water, you can shine ultraviolet (UV) light on them to see them glow\! You can use a UV flashlight or try a simple trick at home.

For the homemade UV light, you'll need your **phone** (or any flashlight), clear **sticky tape**, and a **blue permanent marker**. Stick a piece of tape over the flashlight part of your phone. Then, color over the tape with the blue permanent marker.

Repeat this a few times to get a stronger UV effect.

You can take a cool picture of your glowing balls by turning off the lights in the room and shining your phone's light on them. Easy and awesome, right?
