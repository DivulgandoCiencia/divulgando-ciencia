Let's make a Diana's tree!

## What We Want to Do

The reaction between copper metal and silver ions in a solution also involves a swap of tiny particles called electrons. It's a type of reaction where one thing loses electrons (that's oxidation) and another thing gains them (that's reduction). In this case, the copper metal disappears into the solution, and the silver that was dissolved comes out as shiny silver metal:

## What You'll Need for Diana's Tree

- A piece of copper wire (about 2 cm long)
- Silver nitrate solution (AgNO₃) at 1% or stronger
- A nail or a small piece of iron
- A Petri dish (a shallow, clear dish)

## How to Do It

- Put the piece of copper wire in the Petri dish.
- Carefully cover the wire with a few drops of the silver nitrate solution, making sure the wire is sitting in the solution.

## What's Happening

The silver in the solution that touches the copper wire changes into silver metal, and at the same time, the copper slowly disappears into the solution.

The solid stuff that forms at the beginning might look dark because it has copper oxides in it (CuO is black, and Cu₂O is reddish). You'll see the silver forming later as shiny, branch-like shapes. That's your Diana's tree!
