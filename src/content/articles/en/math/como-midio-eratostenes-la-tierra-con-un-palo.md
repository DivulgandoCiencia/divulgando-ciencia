Discover how the Greek mathematician, Eratosthenes, measured the Earth using just a stick on the summer solstice.

June 21st is the **summer solstice**, the day that marks the beginning of summer.

Over 2,000 years ago, a mathematician named **Eratosthenes** had the brilliant idea of **calculating the Earth's radius with just a stick**. How did he do it? Let’s look!!

## Procedure

1. The first thing he did was obtain a **stick** (a very important step if you want to calculate the Earth’s radius with a stick, as redundant as it may sound).
2. At **solar noon** on the **summer solstice** (exactly), he placed the stick at a **90-degree angle** to the ground.
3. He measured the **angle** formed by the **top of the stick** and the **end of its shadow**.

4. Once he had the angle measurement, he needed one more crucial piece: **the distance from where he was** (Alexandria) to a place on the Tropic of Cancer** (he used Siena). To calculate this distance, he measured the length of a slave’s stride and had him walk the entire distance from Alexandria to Siena.
5. Once he had all the data, he made the following calculation to find the Earth's radius (**important: the angle must be in radians**):
r = distance / angle
And that’s how Eratosthenes calculated the Earth’s radius with this simple reasoning, or was it really that simple? Let’s dive into the explanation!!

## Explanation of How Eratosthenes Measured the Earth with a Simple Stick

At **solar noon** on the **summer solstice**, the Sun's rays fall on the Tropic of Cancer in such a way that **no object casts a shadow**.

If you stand anywhere at that hour and measure the angle formed by the stick with the shadow it casts, you'll notice that this angle is **the same** as the arc formed from where you’re standing to the Tropic of Cancer.

## Demonstration

Of course, it’s not much use just telling you all this without providing a **demonstration**—that’s what we’re here for! Now, let me show you step by step how I replicated what Eratosthenes did more than two thousand years ago.
1. The first thing I did was take a **stick**. Since I couldn’t find one, I decided to use a bottle (you know, got to recycle).
2. I waited for **solar noon on June 21st, 2022 (14:20)**, and when the time arrived, I placed the bottle on a flat surface. I measured the length of the bottle and the shadow it cast, and the data was as follows:
    - **Bottle length = 26 cm**
    - **Shadow length = 10 cm**
3. Once at home, I calculated the tangent arc of these two measurements by dividing them to find the angle in radians:

**arctan(10/26) = arctan(0.38) = 0.3631 rad**

4. Finally, I divided the distance from where I was to the Tropic of Cancer (which was 2315 km):

**r = 2315 / 0.3631 = 6375 km**
