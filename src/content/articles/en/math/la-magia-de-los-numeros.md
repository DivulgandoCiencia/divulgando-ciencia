In this article, I will briefly show how numbers are not just numbers, and how they are not as boring as you might think: in many cases, quite the opposite, as you'll see in the examples I’m going to share now.

# 0542986731

This number contains all the digits (from 0 to 9), and they are arranged alphabetically based on how we name each number in Spanish.

# 1729

It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two different cubes.

# Googol Number

We already talked about this number, created by a 9-year-old child in [this article](/que-es-el-numero-googol), which is an extremely large number. Dare to write it?

# 6174

It’s the number we arrive at after repeatedly performing the following operation: choose any four-digit number (that isn’t made of identical digits). Arrange the digits in descending order and subtract the same digits arranged in ascending order. After repeating this operation several times, we will always end up with the same result: 6174.

# 6

It’s a number whose divisors less than the number itself, both summed and multiplied, give 6. Additionally, it is a triangular number.

# 73

It’s Sheldon’s number, from the famous show *The Big Bang Theory*. It is a peculiar number because it is the 21st prime number; the digits in reverse order, 37, are also prime, which is the 12th prime number, and these digits are the reverse of the prime number 73.
