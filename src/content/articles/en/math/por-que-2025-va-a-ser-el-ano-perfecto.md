The year 2025 has many mathematical properties that make us believe it is going to be the perfect year. In this article, we analyze them all.

## Perfect Square

The most well-known property is that 2025 is a perfect square since 45 squared equals 2025.

![Equation: 45^2 = 2025](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-1.svg)

The next year that will have this property is 2116, as 46 squared equals 2116.

## Product of Two Perfect Squares

Derived from the first property and using the properties of exponents, specifically this one:

![Equation: (a·b)^2 = a^2 · b^2](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-7.svg)

We can deduce that:

![Equation: 45^2 = (9 · 5)^2 = 9^2 · 5^2](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-8.svg)

Therefore, 2025 can also be expressed as the sum of the squares of 9 and 5.

## Sum of Cubes

The sum of the cubes of all the numbers from 0 to 9 results in 2025:

![Equation: 0^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 8^3 + 9^3 = 2025](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-2.svg)

This property only occurs this year, whereas similar properties in other years have been:

- Sum of squares from 0 to 9, which is 285, 1740 years ago.
- Sum of the fourth powers from 0 to 9, which is 15333, in 13308 years.

So, both of these properties are quite far from us.

However, the next two curiosities we will discuss are somewhat related to this...

## Square of the Sum of All Digits

We can express 2025 as the square of the sum of all digits from 0 to 9, thus:

![Equation: (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)^2 = 2025](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-9.svg)

First, we calculate the sum of the digits from 0 to 9:

![Equation: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9 = (1 + 9) · 9 / 2 = 45](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-5.svg)

And we find that:

![Equation: 45^2 = 2025](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-1.svg)

Thus, this property is also proven.

## Sum of the Multiplication Tables from 1 to 9

Another curiosity of this year is that if we sum the multiplication tables (yes, the ones we learned in school) from 1 to 9, the total is 2025.

The multiplication table for 1: 1·1, 2·1, 3·1, 4·1...
The table for 2: 2·1, 2·2, 2·3...

The sum of all the multiplication tables would be expressed something like this:

![Equation: 1·1 + 1·2 + 1·3 + ... 1·9 + 2·1 + ... 2·9 + ... + 9·9](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-3.svg)

This way, we can factor out, since all numbers are multiplied by the same nine numbers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 9.

Thus, we would have:

![Equation: (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9) · (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9)](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-4.svg)

Using the famous Gauss sum, we calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 9:

![Equation: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9 = (1 + 9) · 9 / 2 = 45](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-5.svg)

So we have:

![Equation: (1 + ... + 9) · (1 + ... + 9) = 45 · 45 = 45^2](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-6.svg)

And if we recall the first property:

![Equation: 45^2 = 2025](/images/contenido/por-que-2025-va-a-ser-el-ano-perfecto/ecuacion-1.svg)

Therefore, *QED* (*Quod erat demonstrandum*, "what was to be demonstrated"), which indicates that the initial claim is now proven.

## Conclusions

Well, these are just five mathematical properties, but this year can be perfect; we just need to make it happen ourselves and not wait for someone to tell us. Let's live it!
